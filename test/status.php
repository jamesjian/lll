 *   200 answers, each question has 3-10 answers
 *   150 ads to answers
 * 
 * 
 * 10. 
 * 1-4 question pages use same format: question list(50 records), most popular categories(top 20), 
 * 5-6 category pages use similar format, must have search
 * 7. ads page always under category, no region options
 *    order by weight desc, date_created asc
 * 
 * ad: region, category, weight, date,  (decided by user, for example number of ads is 1000, an accountant ad can have weight 1000 to make sure it's always in the top of list)
 * region is always an attribute
 * order by date_created desc, num_of_view desc, 
 * when the content of a question/answer/ad changed, statistics will be cleared
 * but when extend, will not clear statistics
 * ad validation period: 30 days
 * if no ad for an answer, use a random ad or other way
 * 
 * the above system attract commercial users
 * exchange system is next step to attract non-commercial users
 * 
 * 
 * user: adjust weight of ads
